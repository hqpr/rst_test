Settings

Moved to settings_.

Basic Commands
--------------

Setting Up Your Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

* To create an **superuser account**, use this command::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

Test coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report::

    $ coverage run manage.py test
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

Running tests with py.test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ py.test

Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Moved to `Live reloading and SASS compilation`_.

.. _`Live reloading and SASS compilation`: http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/live-reloading-and-sass-compilation.html

Celery
^^^^^^

This app comes with Celery.

To run a celery worker:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd webchat
    celery -A webchat.taskapp worker -l info

Please note: For Celery's import magic to work, it is important *where* the celery commands are run. If you are in the same folder with *manage.py*, you should be right.

Email Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. For that reason local SMTP server `MailHog`_ with a web interface is available as docker container.

.. _mailhog: https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog

Container mailhog will start automatically when you will run all docker containers.
Please check `cookiecutter-django Docker documentation`_ for more details how to start all containers.

**Alternative running**:

MailHog is built with Go so there are no dependencies. To use MailHog:

1. `Download the latest release`_ for your operating system.
2. Rename the executable to ``mailhog`` and copy it to the root of your project directory.
3. Make sure it is executable (e.g. ``chmod +x mailhog``).
4. Execute mailhog from the root of your project in a new terminal window (e.g. ``./mailhog``).


With MailHog running, to view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to ``http://127.0.0.1:8025``.

Alternatively simply output emails to the console via::

    DJANGO_EMAIL_BACKEND='django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'

Sentry
^^^^^^

Sentry is an error logging aggregator service. You can sign up for a free account at  https://getsentry.com/signup/?code=cookiecutter  or download and host it yourself.
The system is setup with reasonable defaults, including 404 logging and integration with the WSGI application.

You must set the DSN url in production.


Deployment
----------

The following details how to deploy this application.

Getting Up and Running Locally
^^^^^^

The steps below will get you up and running with a local development environment. We assume you have the following installed:

* pip
* virtualenv
* PostgreSQL

Step 1: Create a PostgreSQL user and database with the following commands::

    $ sudo su - postgres
    $ createuser <owning_user>
    $ createdb webchat

Step 2: First make sure to create and activate a `virtualenv`_.

Step 3: Clone this repository.

Step 4: Then install the requirements for your local development::

    $ pip install -r requirements/local.txt
    $ pip install -r requirements/test.txt

Step 5: Create ``.env`` file and add your own environment variables to it.

Step 6: Setup your email backend (see "Email Server" chapter).

Step 7: You can now run the usual Django ``migrate`` and ``runserver`` commands::

    $ python manage.py migrate
